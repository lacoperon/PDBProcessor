# PDB Processor

## Motivation

This is (or is to be) a Bash/Python script to parse PDB structural
files into given subsets of the PDB file (IE only residues 1-495).

Our motivation here is to pre-process some of our ribosome structures in
a standardized way, to ensure our structures have the same number of atoms,
and to confirm that all of our structures are comparable.

## How to run?

Good question; I need to write it first
